## UI/UX Overview
- **Design Language**: Dark glass‑morphism theme with neon accent colors, modern Google Fonts (Inter) and subtle micro‑animations for button presses, knob turns, and step activation.
- **Transport Bar**: Top bar with RUN, STOP, RANDOMIZE, CLEAR, SHARE URL, and Buy Me a Coffee buttons. Includes a large BPM knob with a 7‑segment LED display.
- **Oscilloscope**: Real-time green CRT-style waveform visualization located in the tempo section.
- **Mode Switch**: Animated toggle between Pattern Mode and Song Mode with smooth transition effects.
- **Pattern Mode**: Row of 16 pattern selectors (P1‑P16) with icon-based COPY and PASTE buttons for quick pattern management. Clicking a selector instantly switches the active pattern.
- **Song Mode**: Pattern selectors integrated into the song timeline, allowing multi‑pattern arrangements by tapping a selector. Timeline wraps onto multiple rows, eliminating horizontal scrolling.
- **Sequencer Grid**: 16‑step grid for each TB‑303 unit and each TR‑909 drum track. Steps light up with vibrant colors; slide/accent indicators animate with a pulse.
- **Knob Controls**: Glass‑like circular knobs with reflection; vertical drag changes values, rotation animation provides feedback. Double‑tap resets to default.
- **Toast Notifications**: Visual feedback for copy, paste, and share actions.
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile (portrait/landscape), preserving usability on touch devices.
- **Micro‑Animations**: Hover effects, button depressions, knob rotations, and step activation pulses create a premium, lively feel.
