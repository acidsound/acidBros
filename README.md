# acidBros - Web Audio Acid Studio

**acidBros** is a web‑based synthesizer and sequencer inspired by the legendary Roland TB‑303 Bass Line and TR‑909 Rhythm Composer. It runs directly in your browser using the Web Audio API.

New in the note editor: **TB‑303 Live Mode** with hold-based octave, AC/SL, Rest, and key-transpose performance control (non-destructive to pattern data).

## UI/UX Overview
- **Design Language**: Dark glass‑morphism theme with neon accent colors, modern Google Fonts (Inter) and subtle micro‑animations for button presses, knob turns, and step activation.
- **Transport Bar**: Top bar with FILE MANAGER, RUN, STOP, RANDOMIZE, CLEAR, SHARE URL, and SETTINGS buttons. Includes a large BPM knob with a 7‑segment LED display.
- **Oscilloscope**: Real-time green CRT-style waveform visualization located in the tempo section.
- **Mode Switch**: Animated toggle between Pattern Mode and Song Mode with smooth transition effects.
- **Pattern Mode**: Row of 16 pattern selectors (P1‑P16) with icon-based COPY and PASTE buttons for quick pattern management. Clicking a selector instantly switches the active pattern.
- **Song Mode**: Pattern selectors integrated into the song timeline, allowing multi‑pattern arrangements by tapping a selector. Timeline wraps onto multiple rows, eliminating horizontal scrolling.
- **Sequencer Grid**: 16‑step grid for each TB‑303 unit and each TR‑909 drum track. Steps light up with vibrant colors; slide/accent indicators animate with a pulse.
- **Knob Controls**: Glass‑like circular knobs with reflection; vertical drag changes values, rotation animation provides feedback. Double‑tap resets to default.
- **Toast Notifications**: Visual feedback for copy, paste, and share actions.
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile (portrait/landscape), preserving usability on touch devices.
- **Micro‑Animations**: Hover effects, button depressions, knob rotations, and step activation pulses create a premium, lively feel.

## Usage

1. **Playback**: Press **RUN** to start the sequencer, **STOP** to pause.
2. **Select Mode**: Toggle between **Pattern Mode** and **Song Mode** using the animated MODE switch.
3. **Create a Pattern**:
   * **TB‑303 (Unit 1 & 2)**: Click steps to activate notes, adjust knobs, change notes/octaves via piano roll, toggle AC (Accent) and SL (Slide).
   * **TR‑909**: Click steps on drum tracks, tweak knobs and levels.
