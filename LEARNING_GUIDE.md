## Understanding the Interface

When you first open AcidBros, you'll see several sections on your screen. Don't worry—it might look complex at first, but each section has a clear purpose!

### The Main Sections

![AcidBros Interface](assets/screenshot-desktop.png)

### Key Components Explained

| Section | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Transport Bar** | Controls playback, tempo, and global functions |
| **Pattern Selector** | Switch between 16 different patterns |
| **TB-303 Units** | Two independent bass synthesizers |
| **TR-909** | Drum machine with 5 drum sounds |
| **Oscilloscope** | Visual feedback of your sound (the green waveform) |

## Step-by-Step: Your First Sound

### Step 1: Start the Audio

1. **Open AcidBros** in your browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended)
2. **Click anywhere on the page** if prompted—this activates the audio system
3. Look for the **TEMPO** knob in the top-right area—it shows the current BPM (beats per minute)

### Step 2: Generate a Random Pattern

1. Find the **RANDOMIZE** button in the transport bar (it looks like 🎲)
2. **Click RANDOMIZE** once
3. You'll see the sequencer grids fill with notes and drum hits

### Step 3: Play Your Pattern

1. Click the **RUN** button (▶) in the transport bar
2. **Listen**—you should hear a bass line and drums playing!
3. Watch the red LEDs on the sequencer move from left to right—this shows which step is playing

### Step 4: Stop Playback

1. Click the **STOP** button (⏹) to stop the music
2. Try clicking **RUN** again to continue from where you stopped

## 📝 Exercise: Explore the Randomizer

**Goal**: Get familiar with the variety of sounds AcidBros can create.

1. Make sure playback is **stopped**
2. Click **RANDOMIZE** 5 times in a row
3. After each click, press **RUN** to hear the result
4. Notice how different each pattern sounds!
5. When you find one you like, leave it playing and move to the next chapter

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **No sound at all** | Click anywhere on the page first. Browsers require user interaction before playing audio. |
| **Sound is stuttering** | Close other browser tabs. AcidBros needs some CPU power. |
| **Interface looks wrong** | Try zooming to 100% (Ctrl/Cmd + 0). AcidBros works best at default zoom. |
| **Mobile: Can't adjust knobs** | Drag your finger **up and down** (vertically), not in circles. |

# Chapter 2: Creating Rhythms

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- How to use the 16-step sequencer
- Adding and removing drum hits
- Creating bass patterns with the TB-303
- Adjusting tempo

## Understanding the 16-Step Sequencer

The sequencer is the heart of AcidBros. Think of it like a musical grid:

- Each **row** represents an instrument (bass line or drum sound)
- Each **column** represents a **step** (there are 16 steps in a pattern)
- A step is like a tiny slice of time—when the step is active, the sound plays

```
Step:    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16
Kick:   [●][○][○][○][●][○][○][○][●][○][○][○][●][○][○][○]
Snare:  [○][○][○][○][●][○][○][○][○][○][○][○][●][○][○][○]

(● = sound plays, ○ = silent)
```

## Step-by-Step: Creating a Drum Pattern

### Step 1: Clear Everything

1. Click the **CLEAR** button to start fresh
2. All sequencer grids should now be empty (no lit steps)

### Step 2: Create a Basic Kick Pattern

1. Find the **TR-909** section (usually at the bottom)
2. Look for the row labeled **BD** (Bass Drum / Kick)
3. Click on steps **1, 5, 9, and 13** to create a "four-on-the-floor" beat
4. Press **RUN** to hear your kick drum pattern!

### Step 3: Add a Snare

1. Find the row labeled **SD** (Snare Drum)
2. Click on steps **5** and **13** (beats 2 and 4)
3. This creates a classic house/techno backbeat

### Step 4: Add Hi-Hats

1. Find the row labeled **CH** (Closed Hi-Hat)
2. Click on every step: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16
3. This creates a steady hi-hat rhythm
4. Now find **OH** (Open Hi-Hat) and click steps **3, 7, 11, 15**
5. Notice how open hats cut off the closed hats!

### Step 5: Adjust the Tempo

1. Find the **TEMPO** knob (shows a number like "125")
2. Click and **drag up** to increase tempo (faster)
3. Click and **drag down** to decrease tempo (slower)
4. Try finding a tempo that feels right for your beat (120-130 BPM is typical for house music)

## Step-by-Step: Creating a Bass Pattern

### Step 1: Activate Bass Steps

1. Find **TB-303 Unit 1** (the first bass synthesizer)
2. Click on steps **1, 5, 8, 9, 13** to add notes
3. Each active step shows a note name (like "C")

### Step 2: Change Note Pitches

1. Click on the **note name** (e.g., "C") in any active step
2. A piano keyboard pops up—this is the **Piano Roll**

![Piano Roll](assets/manual-pianoroll.png)

3. Click a different key to change that step's note
4. Press the **×** to close the piano roll
5. Listen to how the melody changes!

### Step 3: Add Variety with Octaves

1. Look below each note display for **DN** and **UP** buttons
2. **DN** = lower octave (deeper bass)
3. **UP** = higher octave (higher pitch)
4. Try setting step 1 to the lowest octave (click DN) and step 9 to the highest (click UP)

## 📝 Exercise: Build a Complete Rhythm

**Goal**: Create a full pattern from scratch.

1. **Clear** the pattern
2. Create this exact drum pattern:
   - **BD (Kick)**: Steps 1, 5, 9, 13
   - **SD (Snare)**: Steps 5, 13
   - **CH (Hi-Hat)**: Steps 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15
   - **CP (Clap)**: Steps 5, 13
3. Add a bass line on TB-303 Unit 1:
   - Activate steps: 1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13
   - Set all notes to "C"
4. Set tempo to **120 BPM**
5. Press **RUN** and enjoy your creation!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Steps won't turn on** | Make sure you're clicking directly on the step button, not the surrounding area. |
| **Piano roll won't open** | Click on the note letter (like "C"), not the step cell. |
| **Tempo resets when I release** | Drag vertically, not horizontally. Release when you have the value you want. |
| **Double-tapped and knob reset** | Double-tap resets knobs to default. This is intentional! Single-click to avoid. |

# Chapter 3: Shaping Sound

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- What each knob on the TB-303 does
- How to create different bass sounds
- The magic of Cutoff, Resonance, and Envelope
- Using Accent and Slide for expression

## The TB-303 Controls Explained

The TB-303 is a **subtractive synthesizer**. Don't let that term scare you—it simply means:

1. Start with a **rich sound** (oscillator)
2. **Subtract** frequencies using a filter
3. Shape the volume over time with an envelope

### The Knobs and What They Do

| Knob | What It Controls | Range | Sweet Spot |
|------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| **WAVEFORM** | Shape of the sound wave | Saw / Square | Try both! |
| **TUNE** | Fine pitch adjustment | -1200 to +1200 cents | Leave at center |
| **CUTOFF** | Brightness of sound | 0-100% | 30-60% for acid |
| **RESO** | "Squelchiness" | 0-15 | 5-12 for classic acid |
| **ENV MOD** | How much the envelope affects cutoff | 0-100% | 40-80% for acid |
| **DECAY** | How long the note rings | 0-100% | 20-50% usually |
| **ACCENT** | Extra punch on accented notes | 0-100% | 50-80% |
| **VOLUME** | Loudness | 0-100% | 60% default |

### Understanding Waveforms

The **waveform switch** toggles between two shapes:

- **Sawtooth (Saw)** 🌊: Bright and buzzy—the classic acid sound
- **Square** ⬛: Hollow and woody—good for deeper bass

**Tip**: Click the waveform switch while the pattern plays to hear the difference!

## Step-by-Step: Crafting the Classic Acid Sound

### Step 1: Set Up a Basic Pattern

1. Click **RANDOMIZE** to get a starting pattern
2. Press **RUN** to hear it

### Step 2: Find the Filter (Cutoff & Resonance)

1. Locate the **CUTOFF** knob on TB-303 Unit 1
2. While music plays, slowly drag the knob **up** (brightens the sound)
3. Then drag it **down** (darkens the sound)
4. Notice how it sounds like the synth is "opening" and "closing"!

### Step 3: Add Resonance

1. Find the **RESO** knob (Resonance)
2. Set it to around 8-10 by dragging up
3. Now move the CUTOFF again—hear that "wah" sound? That's the 303 character!

### Step 4: Add Envelope Modulation

1. Find the **ENV MOD** knob
2. Set it to around 60%
3. Now each note makes the filter "sweep" automatically
4. Try different values—higher = more dramatic sweep

### Step 5: Adjust Decay

1. The **DECAY** knob controls how quickly the note fades
2. Short decay (20%) = punchy, staccato notes
3. Long decay (80%) = sustained, flowing notes
4. Find what fits your pattern!

## Using Accent and Slide

### Accent: Adding Punch

1. Find the **AC** button below any active step
2. Click it to activate accent (button turns red)
3. That step will now play louder and brighter
4. Use accents sparingly for maximum impact!

### Slide: Creating Glides

1. Find the **SL** button below any active step
2. Click it to activate slide (button turns green)
3. The note will now **glide smoothly** to the next note
4. This creates the famous "rubber" effect of acid bass!

**Pro Tip**: Put accent on the first step and slide on the step before an accented step for classic acid phrases.

## 📝 Exercise: Create Three Different Tones

**Goal**: Understand how knobs interact to create different sounds.

### Sound 1: "Bright and Screamy"
- WAVEFORM: Sawtooth
- CUTOFF: 80%
- RESO: 12
- ENV MOD: 70%
- DECAY: 30%

### Sound 2: "Deep and Dark"
- WAVEFORM: Square
- CUTOFF: 25%
- RESO: 4
- ENV MOD: 30%
- DECAY: 60%

### Sound 3: "Classic Acid"
- WAVEFORM: Sawtooth
- CUTOFF: 45%
- RESO: 9
- ENV MOD: 55%
- DECAY: 40%
- Add accents on steps 1 and 9
- Add slides on steps 4, 8, and 12

Listen to each, then experiment with your own combinations!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Sound too quiet** | Increase VOLUME knob. Check that steps are active. |
| **Sound too harsh** | Reduce RESO and/or CUTOFF. |
| **Slides don't work** | Slides only work between two active sequential notes. Make sure both steps have notes. |
| **Can't hear accent difference** | Increase the ACCENT knob value. Try higher RESO too. |
| **Accidentally reset a knob** | You double-tapped. Just re-adjust the knob to your desired value. |

# Chapter 4: Multi-Track Production

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Using both TB-303 units together
- Balancing multiple instruments
- Creating patterns variations
- Using Song Mode to arrange music

## Understanding Multi-Track

AcidBros gives you:

- **2 × TB-303** bass synthesizers (called Unit 1 and Unit 2)
- **5 × TR-909** drum tracks (Kick, Snare, Closed Hat, Open Hat, Clap)

That's **7 independent tracks** you can combine!

### Why Two Bass Lines?

Having two TB-303 units allows you to:

1. Create **call and response** patterns
2. Layer a **bass** line with a **lead** line
3. Use different **waveforms** simultaneously
4. Create **harmonies** or **countermelodies**

## Step-by-Step: Layering Two Bass Lines

### Step 1: Create a Bass Line on Unit 1

1. **Click CLEAR** to start fresh
2. On **TB-303 Unit 1**, activate steps: 1, 5, 9, 13
3. Set all notes to **C** (default)
4. Set **CUTOFF** to 35%, **RESO** to 6
5. Choose **Square** waveform for a deeper sound

### Step 2: Create a Lead Line on Unit 2

1. On **TB-303 Unit 2**, activate steps: 3, 6, 7, 11, 15
2. Click each note and set them to: E, G, A, G, E
3. Set **CUTOFF** to 70%, **RESO** to 10
4. Choose **Sawtooth** waveform for a brighter sound
5. Add slides on steps 7 and 15

### Step 3: Balance the Volumes

1. Find the **VOLUME** knob on each unit
2. Set Unit 1 (bass) to about **70%**
3. Set Unit 2 (lead) to about **50%** (leads usually sit behind bass)
4. Press **RUN** and listen how they work together!

### Step 4: Add Drums

1. In the **TR-909** section, create:
   - **BD**: Steps 1, 5, 9, 13
   - **SD**: Steps 5, 13
   - **CH**: All even steps (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16)
2. Now you have a complete track!

## Working with Patterns

### Understanding Pattern Mode

AcidBros has **16 pattern slots** (P1 through P16). Think of these as 16 different musical "pages" you can create.

### Step 1: Copy Your Work

1. Make sure Pattern Mode is selected (not Song Mode)
2. You should be on **P1** (pattern 1)
3. Click the **COPY** button (📋)
4. A toast message confirms "Pattern copied!"

### Step 2: Create a Variation

1. Click **P2** to switch to pattern 2
2. Click **PASTE** button (📄) to paste your pattern
3. Now modify P2—maybe remove some notes or add accents
4. You now have two versions!

### Step 3: Compare Patterns

1. While music plays, click **P1**—the pattern switches instantly
2. Click **P2**—switches to your variation
3. This is how DJs and producers build tracks!

## Using Song Mode

Song Mode lets you **arrange patterns in order** to create a complete song.

### Step 1: Create Multiple Patterns

1. In **Pattern Mode**, create different patterns in P1, P2, P3, P4
   - P1: Main groove
   - P2: Variation with more hi-hats
   - P3: Breakdown (remove kick)
   - P4: Build-up (add extra notes)

### Step 2: Switch to Song Mode

1. Find the **Mode Switch** between the transport bar and pattern buttons
2. Click to toggle from **Pattern** to **Song**
3. The interface changes to show a timeline

### Step 3: Build Your Song

1. Click pattern buttons (P1, P2, etc.) to add them to the timeline
2. Example arrangement:
   - Click P1 four times
   - Click P2 two times
   - Click P3 two times
   - Click P4 one time
   - Click P1 four times
3. Press **RUN**—the song plays through your arrangement!

### Step 4: Edit the Timeline

- To **remove** a pattern from the timeline, click directly on it
- Build your arrangement however you like!

## 📝 Exercise: Build a Mini-Song

**Goal**: Create a 30-second arrangement using 3 patterns.

1. **Pattern P1**: Full groove (all drums + both bass lines)
2. **Pattern P2**: Breakdown (remove kick drum, only 303 Unit 1)
3. **Pattern P3**: Build-up (all drums, both 303s with lots of slides)
4. **In Song Mode**, arrange: P1, P1, P2, P3, P1, P1
5. Press play and listen to your mini-song!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Can't hear Unit 2** | Check its VOLUME knob. Make sure it has active steps. |
| **Song Mode timeline is empty** | Click pattern buttons (P1-P16) to add them to timeline. |
| **Patterns sound the same** | Each pattern is independent—changes in P1 don't affect P2. |
| **Timeline won't let me add patterns** | Make sure you're in Song Mode, not Pattern Mode. |
| **Pattern buttons don't respond** | In Song Mode, clicking patterns adds them to timeline (doesn't switch patterns). |

# Chapter 6: Advanced Techniques

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Connecting MIDI controllers
- Mapping keyboard keys to controls
- Using the delay effect
- Live performance techniques
- Installing AcidBros as an app

## MIDI Controller Integration

MIDI controllers let you use physical knobs, faders, and buttons to control AcidBros.

### What You Need

- A USB MIDI controller (keyboard, pad controller, or knob controller)
- A modern browser that supports Web MIDI (Chrome, Edge, or other Chromium-based browsers)

### Step 1: Connect Your Controller

1. Plug in your MIDI controller before opening AcidBros
2. Open AcidBros in a modern browser
3. If prompted, **allow** MIDI access

### Step 2: Open the Settings Panel

1. Click the **Settings** button (⚙️) in the transport bar
2. Click the **MIDI** tab

![Settings Panel](assets/manual-settings.png)

3. You should see your controller listed under "MIDI Devices"
4. A green dot means it's connected!

### Step 3: Map a Control

1. In the Settings panel, find "MIDI Mappings"
2. Click **Learn** next to the control you want to map
3. Move the knob/fader or press the button on your MIDI controller
4. The mapping is created instantly!

**Alternative method:**

1. Close Settings
2. Click the **knob** you want to control in the main interface
3. While it's highlighted, move your MIDI controller
4. The mapping is saved!

### Step 4: Test Your Mapping

1. Close the Settings panel
2. Move your physical controller
3. Watch the corresponding knob move on screen!

## Keyboard Mapping

You can also map your PC or Bluetooth keyboard to controls. Keyboard mapping is most useful for **transport controls** (Play/Stop) and **pattern selection** (P1-P16), as these are simple on/off triggers.

> **Note**: Keyboard keys work as simple triggers (on/off), so they're not suitable for continuous controls like knobs (Cutoff, Resonance, etc.). For knob control, a MIDI controller with physical knobs or faders is recommended.

### Step 1: Map a Keyboard Key

1. Open **Settings** (⚙️)
2. Click the **MIDI** tab
3. Click **Learn** next to any control
4. Press a key on your keyboard (e.g., "1")
5. Now pressing that key activates that control!

### Recommended Keyboard Mappings

| Key | Best Used For |
|-----|---------------|
| Spacebar | Play/Stop |
| 1-9, 0 | Patterns P1-P10 |
| Q, W, E, R | Patterns P11-P14 |
| Z, X | Waveform toggle (Unit 1, Unit 2) |

## Mastering the Delay Effect

Each TB-303 has a built-in **tempo-synced delay**.

### Understanding Delay Controls

| Knob | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **TIME** | Delay time as % of beat (50% = eighth note, 100% = quarter note) |
| **FEEDBACK** | How many echoes (0% = one echo, 100% = infinite) |

### Step-by-Step: Using Delay Creatively

1. Set your pattern playing
2. On TB-303 Unit 1, find the **DELAY** section
3. Set **TIME** to 50% (eighth-note delays)
4. Set **FEEDBACK** to 30%
5. Listen to the echoes!

### Creative Delay Tips

- **1-2% Time**: Creates a **doubling effect**—thickens the sound without obvious echo (great for adding width!)
- **75% Time**: Dotted eighth notes (used in "The Edge" style guitar)
- **100% Time**: Quarter notes (straight echoes)
- **150% Time**: Dotted quarter notes (more spaced out)
- **High Feedback (60%+)**: Creates washy, ambient textures
- **Low Feedback (20%)**: Subtle thickening

## Live Performance Techniques

### Collapsible Sequencers

1. Click on the **header** of any TB-303 or TR-909 section
2. The sequencer grid collapses, showing only knobs
3. This is perfect for live tweaking—focus on the sound!
4. Click again to expand

### Swing/Shuffle for Groove

1. Click the **Shuffle** button
2. A ribbon controller appears
3. Drag to adjust swing (0% = straight, 50% = default, 100% = heavy shuffle)
4. Swing makes your rhythm feel more "human" and groovy

### Real-Time Knob Tweaking

The heart of acid music is **live filter manipulation**:

1. Start your pattern playing
2. Grab the **CUTOFF** knob
3. Slowly sweep it up and down
4. Add occasional **RESONANCE** peaks
5. This is the classic acid performance style!

## Installing as a PWA (App)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **MIDI controller not detected** | Refresh the page. Check Settings → MIDI tab. Try unplugging and replugging. |
| **Chrome won't ask for MIDI permission** | Make sure you're using HTTPS (the live site), not HTTP. |
| **Keyboard keys trigger browser shortcuts** | Some keys like Spacebar may scroll the page. Map different keys. |
| **PWA won't install** | Make sure you're on the live site (acidsound.github.io), not localhost. |
| **Delay sounds weird when stopped** | This is normal—delay fades out when you stop playback. |
